# Celestial's art style

I am not entirely certain what the art style is going to be. I do know that I am going to be using vector graphics with a touch of procedural animation.

Currently, everything in this directory is "alpha" art, for practice and for defining a solid art style.

Eventually I want to replace all of it with the final versions, after the art style is solidified and the animation system is usable.

Note: It might be worth creating a VSCode extension to preview them once the custom animated vector graphics format is finished
