# Story

The story is entirely not ready in the slightest, however there are a few things I am cartain about.

- A story system similar to The Captain where the player is pretty much entirely in control of where they go and what they do, (like most sandbox games), however the story is still very important and has a significant impact on gameplay.
- a companion that follows the character throughout the story (unless the player decides to abandon them or something)
    - make them NOT annoying, apparently that's really common with sidekicks in games
